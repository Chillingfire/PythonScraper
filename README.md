# PythonScraper

<h3>*NOT FINISHED*</h3>
<b><i>Learning Purpose of this Project:</b> To improve knowledge of developing in Python and how to use it for web-based applications.</i>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
The year is 2021. The people of the world are devoid of desktop graphics cards, and the future of humanity is on the brink of destruction...<br><br>
I'm just kidding, I'm just trying to add a "humerous spin" to a Github readme file. However, it does provide some context to this program. In the graphics card space 
right now, there has been a serious shortage of stock ever since Nvidia released their new lineup of 30-series graphics cards. Ever since then, graphics cards have either been
out of stock, used for cryptocurrency mining, or resold at ridiculous prices. It's safe to say that right now, it's not a good time to build a custom PC.

<h3>The Program</h3>
This is where this project comes in. The Python Scraper (patent pending) will allow you to look up websites that sell graphics cards (right now it's just Newegg.com)
and compare prices, chipsets, brands, etc. It will solve all of your problems! <br><br>
In all seriousness, this is just a small side project I've been working on so I could get better at using Python. This program is basically a web scraper that takes
information from a website, and converts it into a .CSV file that you can view in something like Excel. Overall, this project is just helping me personally get familar
with web scraping and Python (which is pretty interesting by the way). In conclusion, thanks for checking out this repo, and be sure to look at my other projects as well!<br><br>
